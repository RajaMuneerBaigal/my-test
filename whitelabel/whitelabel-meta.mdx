title: Adding Meta integrations
---

## Meta App

In order to add Meta integrations (Facebook Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp), you must first create a Meta App for your business. You can visit [Meta's guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app/other-app-types) to get started. You will want to create a "Business" type app, since we will need access to the messaging APIs.

## Obtaining App Secrets

Once you have created your Meta App, you can visit the "App settings" section of your Meta App Dashboard to view your app's ID and secret.

You should copy these values, and then paste them into your Chatsistant Partners Dashboard, under the "Integrations" tab.

There is one more secret you will need: the verification token. This can be any alphanumeric string of suitable length (e.g. 32 characters), so feel free to use a password generator or similar method to create it. Once you have done so, please enter it in the appropriate box in the Chatsistant Partners Dashboard. Please save this value for your own records.

## Webhooks

In general, you will want to use Meta's API version 20.0 for all your webhooks.

## Configurations

You can find the configuration IDs for your integrations under the "Facebook Login for Business" tab of your Meta App Dashboard. For each integration you wish to add (Facebook Messenger, Instagram, or WhatsApp), please copy the configuration ID for that integration and paste it into your Chatsistant Partners Dashboard.

## Publishing

You will need to request for Meta to approve your app. You will likely need to create test accounts during this process.

If you wish to add Meta integrations to existing Stripe plans, the metadata key is `meta_integration`. You should set it to `True`.
